# My Home Operations Repository

_... managed with Flux, SOPS, and GitHub Actions_ ü§ñ

---

## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the configuration for my home infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster. I follow Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

My Kubernetes cluster is deployed with [Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) on a single powerful node. For persistent storage, I use [OpenEBS HostPath](https://github.com/openebs/dynamic-localpv-provisioner) and [OpenEBS ZFS](https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv).

### Core Components

- [cert-manager](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager): Automates the creation and management of TLS certificates.
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): Provides networking, security, and observability for the cluster.
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets): Syncs secrets from external APIs into Kubernetes.
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx): Acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer for Kubernetes services.
- [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops): Encrypts and manages secrets within Git.

### GitOps and Automation

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) monitors the `kubernetes` directory in this repository and ensures the cluster state matches the configuration. Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically applied to the cluster.

I use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous integration and deployment workflows, leveraging self-hosted GitHub runners within the cluster for execution.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Dependencies

While the core infrastructure is self-hosted, I utilize a few cloud services for critical functionalities:

| Service                                   | Purpose                                               | Cost         |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| [Migadu](https://migadu.com/)             | Email hosting                                         | ~$90/year    |
| [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) | DNS, domain management and R2 bucket                  | ~$8/month    |
| [GitHub](https://github.com/)             | Repository hosting and CI/CD pipelines                | Free         |
| [Pushover](https://pushover.net/)         | Application and system notifications                  | $5 one-time  |

## üåê DNS and Networking

My network is managed using a [UniFi Dream Machine Pro Max](https://store.ui.com/us/en/category/cloud-gateways-large-scale/products/udm-pro-max), which serves as the router, firewall, and DNS server for my home network.
